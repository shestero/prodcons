The C/C\+\+ coding test 





**The Coding Assignment **


Please, write a program, that solves a regular quadratic equation: 



The program receives parameters of the equation as a stream of numbers from the command line: 



> se\_solver 3 4 5 0 4 -4 11 22 123 45 42 42 67 1001 … 



All number are integers and some of them can be 0. 

Your task is: 

1. solve a square equation for each parameters trey and print out found roots or print out a message that this given trey does not have any roots; 

2. find an extremum of a parabola created by each trey. An extremum can be found using the first derivative of the equation; 



The results might look like this: 





Your code should comply with the following conditions: 

1. Provide correct solutions of all equations. 

2. Provide correct value of all extremums. 

3. Your code should have a protection against input garbage \(… 1 -2 -3 4 aaa 11 22 …\). 

4. Demonstrate your understanding of the Object-Oriented Design and work with C\+\+ STL. 

5. Demonstrate your understanding and ability to use C\+\+ multithreading for all necessary calculations. As we discussed, please, use Consumer-Producer pattern. 

6. Your code must be well commented, please do not make comments with outside links or reference to articles that you have read once and liked. All comment must be your own and explain your coding decision. 

7. Your code should demonstrate the effective data processing and general performance. 



You can use the any C\+\+ compiler available for you, however it must be easy to build using MS Visual Studio or cmake. 

Please, do not make extra efforts and go beyond these conditions. 



We wish you good luck and looking forward to your solution.
